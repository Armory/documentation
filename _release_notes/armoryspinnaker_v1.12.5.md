{:.no_toc}
> Note: this is the release notes comparing against [v1.10.207](https://docs.armory.io/release-notes/armoryspinnaker_v1.10.207/), because v1.11.262 has stability issues.

> Note: For some cases we are seeing issues when passing parent parameters using SpEL, or pipeline expressions, to child pipelines from parent pipelines.

> Note: If you're experiencing production issues after upgrading Spinnaker, rollback to a [previous working version](http://docs.armory.io/admin-guides/troubleshooting/#i-upgraded-spinnaker-and-it-is-no-longer-responding-how-do-i-rollback).

## Highlighted Updates
### Armory

#### Platform&trade;
- Slackbot Alpha
- Oneclick Alpha


#### Deck-Armory
- New styling for splash page
- New styling for Spinnaker background



###  Spinnaker Community Contributions
We've are now tracking Spinnaker releases, namely, [release-v1.6.x](https://www.spinnaker.io/community/releases/versions/1-6-0-changelog) instead of HEAD of each subservice for stability purposes.

This release has early access functionality for the [Kubernetes V2 provider](http://docs.armory.io/user-guides/kubernetes-v2/), modifies trigger execution and processing within Orca, and adds ECS support.
