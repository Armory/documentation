## Known Issues

#### Spinnaker can't access some files
Spinnaker changed the user it runs as in a container from `root` to `spinnaker` for security reasons.
See the [Issue 2606](https://github.com/spinnaker/spinnaker/issues/2606) for more information.

Symptoms:
```
unable to read client-key /certs/spinnaker.key for spinnaker due to open /certs/spinnaker.key: permission denied
```

Workaround:  
A solution will be provided in a future release. The work around for now is changing the ownership of the file in the running container.
Here's an example for clouddriver for the user `spinnaker` (id 100):
```bash
sudo docker exec -it -u root clouddriver chown 100:65533 /certs/spinnaker.*
```
This can be done in [`/opt/spinnaker/bin/secrets`](https://github.com/armory/spinnaker-config-deb/blob/master/deb-config/spinnaker/bin/secrets) or in your userdata.


## Highlighted Updates
### Armory
- We've been adding a lot of things preparing for our Armory Kubernetes Installations! Stay tuned!
- For our Configurator users, you can now visit [https://YOUR_SPINNAKER_URL_HERE/#/platform/config/](https://YOUR_SPINNAKER_URL_HERE/#/platform/config/) for our new style.


###  Spinnaker Community Contributions
There have also been numerous enhancements, fixes and features across all of Spinnaker's other services. See their changes here:  
[Spinnaker's v1.7.0](https://www.spinnaker.io/community/releases/versions/1-7-0-changelog)  
[Spinnaker's v1.7.1](https://www.spinnaker.io/community/releases/versions/1-7-1-changelog)  
[Spinnaker's v1.7.2](https://www.spinnaker.io/community/releases/versions/1-7-2-changelog)  
[Spinnaker's v1.7.3](https://www.spinnaker.io/community/releases/versions/1-7-3-changelog)  
[Spinnaker's v1.7.4](https://www.spinnaker.io/community/releases/versions/1-7-4-changelog)  


#### Igor
Igor added polling safeguards for Docker, Jenkins, Gitlab, and Travis. This shouldn't effect upgrades, unless those service pointers are out of date.

**Symptoms:**
- New Docker, Jenkins, Gitlab, and/or Travis artifacts aren't showing up in the job selector.
- New Docker, Jenkins, Gitlab, and/or Travis artifacts don't trigger pipelines.
- An error message from Igor looking like:
```
ERROR 1 --- [readScheduler-3] c.n.spinnaker.igor.docker.DockerMonitor  : Number of items (1155) to cache exceeds upper threshold (1000) in monitor=DockerMonitor partition=gcr
```

**Fix:**
You'll need to add this into your `igor-local.yml`
```yaml
# Added this to igor-local.yml to up the threshold; otherwise
# igor just doesn't bother looking for anything new.
spinnaker:
  pollingSafeguard:
    itemUpperThreshold: 10000  # find the exact number in Igor logs
```
