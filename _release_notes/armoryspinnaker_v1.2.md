## Spinnaker Community Contributions

## Clouddriver
- (aws) Update to the latest AWS SDK
- (aws) ASG Lifecycle Hooks
- (aws) Instance termination lifecycle agent; early-notifies Eureka of termination events
- (aws) adds options in deploy / clone server group to control whether ancestor ASG custom block device and spotPrice are carried forward
- Ensure queue/topic exists on every iteration of the launch failure agent
- (amazon) Log all requests to create launch configurations (sans user data)

## Echo

## Gate
- A relaxed RedisHealthIndicator that will never report DOWN once UP
- (cors) - adds a configurable allowedOriginsPattern to whitelist cors access to spinnaker API (breaking) With the change to whitelist cors requests to a specified - regex, anyone relying on the open cors policy will be impacted (if you have developed a separate browser based webapp that uses the spinnaker api, and you have - - authentication enabled you will need to whitelist the host domain for that webapp to propagate the authentication for API requests)
- Adding regex support for oauth2 user info requirements
- update entity tags via POST, partial delete operation

## Deck
- (core) allow users to configure traffic protected clusters
- (aws) Bug-fix bad rendering of instance details title.

- (all providers) Show that an instance is not found instead of failing silently
- (aws) Quick Patch ASG stage requires a jenkins trigger or stage
- (docker) Add image name, tag and organization to docker bake stage.
- (docker) Make bake stage show up in list of stage choices even when no providers that explicitly provide bake stage are configured.
- (core): upgrade core libs and fix resulting issues
- (core) retry tagging before failing; make retryService tolerate failure
- (core) added validator for service account access
- (core) use IRegionalCluster for entityRef building
