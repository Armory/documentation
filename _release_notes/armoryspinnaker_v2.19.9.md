## Breaking Changes

### Required Halyard version

Armory Spinnaker 2.19.x requires Armory Halyard 1.8.3 or later.

### HTTP sessions for Gate
Armory Spinnaker 2.19.x includes an upgrade to the Spring Boot dependency. This requires you to flush all the Gate sessions for your Spinnaker deployment. For more information, see [Flushing Gate Sessions](https://kb.armory.io/admin/flush-gate-sessions/).

### Scheduled Removal of Kubernetes V1 Provider
The Kubernetes V1 provider will be removed in Spinnaker 1.21. Please see the [RFC](https://github.com/spinnaker/governance/blob/master/rfc/eol_kubernetes_v1.md) for more details.

Breaking change: Kubernetes accounts with an unspecified providerVersion will now default to V2. Update your Halconfig to specify `providerVersion: v1` for any Kubernetes accounts you are currently using with the V1 provider.

## Known Issues

### Upgrading from 2.18.x with MySQL used for Front50 renames the plugin_artifacts table
As a part of the upgrade from 2.18.x to 2.19.x, the table **plugin_artifacts** gets renamed to `plugin_info`. Downgrades from 2.19.x to 2.18.x do not revert the table name. The table remains named `plugin_info`, preventing access to the table.  

This issue only occurs if you upgrade to 2.19.x and then downgrade.

## Highlighted Updates

### Armory

This release includes several fixes to CVEs in addition to bug fixes and general improvements. 

Armory has also made enhancements to the following feature:

### Pipelines as code

- Messages surfaced by Pipelines as code (through the Dinghy service) to GitHub now provide more information about warnings or failures in pipeline rendering.
- Pipelines as code now supports validating stage references in a pipeline. If you attempt to save a pipeline that references a stage that does not exist, you get a warning.

### Security update

This releases focuses on making Spinnaker more secure. Although several CVEs are resolved, the following still exist:

#### Clouddriver

The following three CVEs still exist in Clouddriver:

- CVE-2020-1747
- CVE-2017-18342
- CVE-2016-10745

All three are embedded dependencies in the Google Cloud SDK. A version of the Google Cloud SDK addressing these CVEs has not been released. The risk to Clouddriver users is low: all three CVEs deal with untrusted input, which Clouddriver does not provide to the Google Cloud SDK. Additionally, users deploying to other cloud providers are not at risk for this vulernability.

#### Igor

The following CVE still exists in Igor:

- CVE-2017-1000190

Igor depends on SimpleXML as a transitive dependency. The Travis and Jenkins modules use for annotations in their models. Because Igor uses the Jackson library to parse XML directly, the service is not at risk for this vulnerability.

###  Spinnaker Community Contributions

There have also been numerous enhancements, fixes and features across all of Spinnaker's other services from the open source community. See highlights and detailed changes here:
