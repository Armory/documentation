#Working with Jenkins

This guide should include:

- how to trigger Spinnaker pipelines from Jenkins
- how to trigger Jenkins' jobs from Spinnaker


##triggers


To add a Jenkins trigger to your pipeline, go to your configurations stage and select "add trigger", select "Jenkins" from the Type dropdown menu. Select a Master from the Master category list and then select a Job to trigger from the pipeline.

Note: Make sure you archive your package files and your properties file in Jenkins. 


Property File

The property file is a way to transfer information about your build from Jenkins to Spinnaker. The file needs to be archived by the Jenkins job and should contain key value pairs. 

In this example, my Jenkins job archived this file `build.properties` to look like:


```COMMITER_NAME=andrew
BRANCH_NAME=mybranch
CONFIG=config-3059cad.tar.gz```


Then in the property files field in the Spinnaker Jenkins trigger, fill it in with `build.properties`.

Now that those variables are in Spinnaker, we can access them elsewhere in our pipeline by using the built-in Spinnaker expression language. 



In any given stage we can use the expression language `${#trigger.parameters['BRANCH_NAME']}` to access the property value of the varable named `BRANCH_NAME`.

Note: For more elaborate instructions on expression language, please refer to the [Spinnaker Expression Language Guide](link placeholder).
