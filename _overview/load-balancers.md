Things to do beforehand:

- Before you create a Load Balancer, your Security Group will already need to exist.

Step 3: The Stack and Detail should be kept in mind when creating the pipeline because the pipeline’s deployment of server group should be using the same Stack and Detail. 


## Delete a Load Balancer

Note: You can only delete Load Balancers if they do not have any instances attached to them. 

Step 1: Go to your Load Balancers in your Applications.

Step 2: Select a Load Balancer, then to the right a column with the Load Balancer’s details should appear. Select the drop down menu and press “Delete”.
